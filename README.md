## Introduction

This repository contains a set of diagnostic files comparing different perturbations to a control simulation of the ocean. These perturbations are with respect to the surface winds, i.e., we consider an oceanic model where we do not have any wind stress feeding momentum into the ocean. Through these experiments, we aim to deepen our understanding of the specific interplay of wind stress and surface buoyancy forcing on large scale ocean circulations.
